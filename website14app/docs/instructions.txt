Read and analyze the entire project, reviewing each and every file to fully understand the complete scope.  
Once you have the full context, focus on understanding the Firebase Datastore usage.  

Key requirements:  
- Identify every datastore (Firestore collections).  
- List what collections exist, what information each collection stores, and the key fields in them.  

Task:  
- Create the file `docs/firebase_datastore_details.md`.  
- Keep explanations short and precise (just enough detail for the AI to understand later).  
- Add Mermaid diagrams to visually represent relationships between collections for human understanding.  

Important:  
- Do not write lengthy descriptions.  
- Be clear, concise, and structured.
