Limited customization. You’re stuck doing everything yourself.\n- **Freelancers**: May be affordable at first, but vanish after delivery. No ongoing support, no accountability.\n- **Agencies**: Charge thousands for a basic site. Every small edit costs extra. Delay after delay.\n\nThe result? Businesses waste time, energy, and money — and still don’t get the results they need.\n\n---\n\n## 💻 Website14: A Web Partner, Not Just a Vendor\n\nWe decided to flip the script.\n\nWebsite14 isn’t a tool. It isn’t just a service.  \n**It’s your tech co-founder — without equity.**\n\nHere’s what makes us different:\n\n### ✅ One-Time Setup.

SEO-Centric. Speed Obsessed.\nEvery website we build is:\n- Optimized for **mobile-first performance**\n- Includes **on-page SEO** and metadata\n- Loads blazing fast (often under 1 second!)\n- Built with **best practices** in HTML/CSS/JS\n- Secured with **SSL + hardening** at no extra cost\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Which Plan Is Right for You?\n\nWe offer **three simple packages**:\n\n| Feature             | Static Website | Dynamic Website | E-commerce Website |\n|---------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Pages Included       | 5              | 7                | 10                  |\n| Extra Page Price     | ₹300 / $4       | ₹400 / $6        | ₹500 / $8           |\n| Admin Panel          | No             | Basic CMS        | Full Dashboard      |\n| Product Listings     | No             | 1                | 30                  |\n| Extra Product Upload | No             | No               | ₹20 / $0.30         |\n| Payment Gateways     | No             | 1 Gateway        | 2 Gateways          |\n| Extra Gateway Cost   | —              | ₹500 / $7         | ₹500 / $7           |\n| Setup Fee (One-Time) | ₹4,999 / $69    | ₹9,999 / $139     | ₹14,999 / $199       |\n| Monthly Fee          | ₹399 / $4.99    | ₹599 / $7.99      | ₹899 / $11.99        |\n\nWe also offer **yearly, 2-year, and 3-year discounts** and email hosting at just ₹199 / $2.49 per mailbox.\n\n---\n\n## 🌎 Built for India.
