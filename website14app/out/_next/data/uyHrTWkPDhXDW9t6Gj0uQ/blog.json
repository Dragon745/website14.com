You’ll get scores and improvement tips for mobile & desktop.\n\n### 2. **Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)**  \nRight-click on your site → Inspect → Lighthouse tab → Run audit.\n\n### 3. **Search Console (Web Vitals Report)**  \nIf your site is verified in Google Search Console, go to the “Core Web Vitals” tab for actual field data.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 How to Improve Core Web Vitals\n\nImproving scores usually means improving:\n\n### ✅ Hosting & CDN\n- Switch to faster hosting\n- Use CDN like Cloudflare or BunnyCDN\n- Reduce server response times (TTFB)\n\n### ✅ Images & Media\n- Compress images (WebP > JPEG/PNG)\n- Use lazy loading\n- Avoid layout shifts by defining dimensions\n\n### ✅ Scripts & Fonts\n- Minify JS & CSS\n- Load fonts locally or use `font-display: swap`\n- Reduce third-party scripts\n\n### ✅ UI Stability\n- Reserve space for ads/images before they load\n- Avoid animations that push content\n\n---\n\n## 💼 What Website14 Does to Help Clients Stay Compliant\n\nAll websites built at **Website14** are:\n\n- Mobile-first responsive  \n- Optimized for LCP, INP, CLS  \n- Tested with Lighthouse, GTmetrix, and PageSpeed  \n- Hosted on fast servers with caching and compression  \n- Delivered with proper image sizing and lazy loading  \n- Periodically reviewed for performance\n\nIn other words — we do the hard part, so you don’t have to.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Bonus Tip: Core Web Vitals Are Not Just SEO — They're UX\n\nEven if you don't care about Google rankings, improving Web Vitals:\n\n- Increases conversions\n- Boosts sales\n- Makes users stay longer\n- Reduces bounce rate\n- Works better on slow networks\n\nGoogle just happens to reward it.\n\n---\n\n## 📬 Need Help Fixing Your Website’s Performance?\n\nWe specialize in **making fast, beautiful, and Google-compliant websites** — even if we didn’t build your site originally.\n\n👉 [Book a performance audit](https://www.website14.com)  \n📩 Or email us directly: [support@website14.com](mailto:support@website14.com)","title":"Why Google Is Pushing for Core Web Vitals — And How It Affects Your Website in 2025","tags":["core web vitals","seo","web performance","google update","lighthouse","speed optimization","UX","technical SEO"],"status":"published"},{"id":"yYUk2I0hD2NouKsfOoUp","publishedAt":"2025-08-03T16:45:52.669Z","title":"How Website14 Is Disrupting the Web Development Industry in India and Beyond","seo":{"keywords":"\"web development India\", \"best website for small business\", \"affordable web agency\", \"Website14 reviews\", \"Website14 pricing\", \"SEO web design\", \"ecommerce developer India\", \"web agency for startups\"","metaTitle":"Website14: High-Quality, Affordable Websites for Small Businesses in India & USA","metaDescription":"At Website14, we provide expert-built websites with unlimited edits, hosting, and maintenance — at startup-friendly prices.

No ongoing support, no accountability.\n- **Agencies**: Charge thousands for a basic site. Every small edit costs extra. Delay after delay.\n\nThe result? Businesses waste time, energy, and money — and still don’t get the results they need.\n\n---\n\n## 💻 Website14: A Web Partner, Not Just a Vendor\n\nWe decided to flip the script.\n\nWebsite14 isn’t a tool.
